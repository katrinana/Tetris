The enhancement I have is level. For every 3 lines you deleted, you go up a level. As the level goes up, the speed gets fast. The rate is 10% per level. 

I also create Hold for my game, which means you can hold at most 4 pieces. You save them up by pressing H. If you want to reuse them, press A. After that, your current piece still moving down, but the next piece shown up is the piece in Hold area instead of the piece in Next area. The hold order is first save last use.
